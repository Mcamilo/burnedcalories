## Lecture 06 - Regression and Deployment
In this lecture we conducted an Exploratory Data Analysis on the calories/exercises datasets, we induced a Regression Model to predict the amount of calories that a person would burn during a workout, and lastly we serve this model with the Model Serving Pattern: Model-as-service, and deploy it as Docker Containers.
